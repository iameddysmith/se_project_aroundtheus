# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Description**

This is a project entitled 'Around the U.S.' My third project in the TripleTen Software Engineer course. With this project there was a lot of new concepts to learn.

- Responsive Design (Adapting to different devices)
- Loading fonts in the project rather than just linking
- Creating a website based off Figma
- Utilizing GitHub as a save point tool
- Using BEM methodology for a cleaner, logic-based way of designing the webpage
